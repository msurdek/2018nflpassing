# SideProjects19-21

Some projects I have worked on outside of work and school in an attempt to learn statistics and data science

NFL Passing: My first project applying linear regression to NFL passing statistics

Sales: Trying to see if demographic info can predict Boston Sports Clubs membership sales

Learning R: A couple of visualizations made from more NFL and BSC data

Tidy Tuesday: A few attempts at the weekly social data science project on Twitter. I explored NHL goal scoring, beer production over time, and the TV show The Office.
